# Poker Pre-Alpha 0.0.0

This is a simple multiplayer poker game. It is server-client based and
requires that you open the port that you set. I am doing this project as
a side project for fun in my free time. I plan on continuuing to work on
this and possibly updaing the back end to make it an easier game to
access.
